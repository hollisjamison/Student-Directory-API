# Student-Directory

## Objective
The objective of this project was to create a full CRUD REST API for a student directory, as well as a frontend to render the information.

## Structure & Functionality
This API utilizes a MySQL database to store the student information, as well as a Pug frontend for the rendering.

The database contains a single table with 10 columns (id, name, age, address, gpa, major, image, createdAt, updatedAt, & deletedAt). The application uses the Sequelize ORM to connect to the database and it is then parsed into JSON format.

The frontend of the application utilizes the Pug template-engine as well SCSS for styling. All images used are svgs saved within the assets folder of the repo.
